# IR Lamp Design

## Working
This project is a simple implementation of the use of IR signals for controlling a set of LED Lights. The remote consists of a simple push button which will turn on the lights.
The Schematics have been referenced from Circuit Digest

## Future Improvements
Interfacing the Lamp project with a Decade Counter to make the system controllable using a remote control.
