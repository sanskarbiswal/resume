## About Me
I am a student currently studying Electronics and Communication Engineering (B.Tech) at VIT, Vellore and presently in my 7th semester. I am an Embedded Systems and ML developer. I like to read and explore new stuff, meet people and collaborate on projects.). I avidly follow the various forums and DIY projects in the community looking for inspirations, to learn to design better solutions.

## Projects in this git-repo
Over my 6-semesters in engineering, I have worked on various projects as a part of my courses. Some of them are fully original, while most of them ar just repurposing of the existing projects in terms of circuit development, code or just end-user application.

My purpose of putting these projects here is to preserve them as well as share them with anyone interested to know what projects are done as a B.Tech in ECE. Having said that, these projects are neither the benchmark nor the representation of all the projects done by students at graduate level.

Note:
```
The projects uploaded here may or maynot be in a fully functional order. 
They were most likely running at the time of presentation, but I may 
not have preserved every necessary reference to recreate these projects.

These projects and their schematics and code are for reference only.
